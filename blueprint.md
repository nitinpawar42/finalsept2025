1.1 Project Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the development of a modern, scalable eCommerce platform designed for a reseller business model. The system will facilitate three distinct user roles (Admin, Reseller, Customer) and integrate with third-party services for payments (Razorpay) and shipping (Delhivery). The primary goal is to empower resellers with tools to sell effectively while providing administrators with full oversight and control.

1.2 Problem Statement

The current process for managing resellers and orders is manual and inefficient. There is a need for an automated, centralized system to:

Streamline the reseller onboarding and approval process.

Provide a dedicated portal to manage their products and customers.

Automate key operations like invoice generation and shipping cost calculation.

2. Objectives & Goals

O1: Automate the Reseller Registration and Admin Approval workflow.

O2: Provide a dedicated Admin Dashboard for complete business oversight (users, orders, sales).

O3: Empower Resellers with a portal to view products, manage customers, and track orders.

O4: Deliver a seamless Customer checkout experience with integrated payment and real-time shipping costs.

O5: Automate post-purchase processes: PDF invoice generation, storage, and email delivery.

3. Scope
3.1 In-Scope

User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Reseller Registration and Approval Flow.

Admin, Reseller, and Customer portals/dashboards.

Product & Order Management.

Advanced marketing features (email campaigns, coupons).

Inventory management and warehousing systems.

Customer product reviews and ratings.

    *   Fetched the order details from Firestore before calling the `generate-invoice` API.
*   **Admin Dashboard:**

    *   Modified `src/pages/checkout.astro` to include a customer selection dropdown, and pass the selected `customerId` when creating an order.
    *   Updated `src/pages/api/verify-payment.js` to use the `customerId` from the order to fetch the correct customer's details from the `customers` collection for generating the invoice.
*   **Admin Dashboard Data:**
    *   Implemented data fetching in `src/components/AdminDashboard.jsx` to display real-time data for total sales, recent orders, and pending reseller approvals.
